# Sleep Study:

Summary:

This project presents several visualizations showing the affects of sleep throughout different parts of the country.

Important Notes:

Two files need to be run to see the full project. The python app.py file that connects to the data on SQLite should be run separately 
and will show you a webpage with a table of the compiled state data that was used.  

The visualizations can be seen by launching the index.html file and using the NAV bar to navigate to the different pages (health factors, map, and income).
